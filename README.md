# How To Use The Bot
* VERY IMPORTANT: Inside the 'resources' folder, you have to unpack either the 1080p or 1440p icons. If your monitor is 1080p, unpack the 1080p icons, and vice versa. Simply press 'extract here', on the correct icon set:\
![2022-11-08 05_05_37-resources](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71074471/200472807-9ad5f0ac-2815-4891-85e1-bebc4e534689.png)\
* In your newly extracted folder, open the FOCCH.exe file, and the bot should open:\

(Keep in mind that a console window also opens, that will display logs of what the bot is doing!)\
* When you have the bot open, start by choosing whether or not you want to use bait. The first checkbox activates bait selection:\

* Additionally, you'll have to choose a bait slot. Here is what i mean by bait slots:\

* Now you're ready to set a repairing interval. Depending on how durable your fishing rod is, you can increase this number, so that the bot doesnt repair as frequently:\

* In your IN-GAME settings, make sure that you bind the 'b' key to 'free-look'. Test that the key works before starting the bot! Otherwise it will not be able to recenter the camera:\

* You're all set! Press start fishing, and then make sure your game windows is in focus, and in full screen! The bot will start fishing on its own!
